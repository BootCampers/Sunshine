        <item>The Mercator projection used here is one way of looking at the spherical earth as a flat map. Used since the 16th century for navigation, straight lines on this map can be used accurately as compass bearings but the size and shape of continents are distorted. Compare this with Peters, Mollweide or equirectangular projection maps.</item>

        <item>The Mollweide projection is one way of looking at the spherical earth as a flat map. Useful for political maps, it shows the true area of land masses, choosing instead to distort their shape. Compare this with Peters, Mercator or equirectangular projection maps.</item>

        <item>Known as a plate carr√©e or equirectangular projection, this map is one way of looking at the spherical Earth as a flat map. Though it distorts area, shape, and angles, it is often used in computer applications because the X and Y axis map directly to latitude and longitude. Compare this with Mercator, Peters, or Mollweide projection maps.</item>
